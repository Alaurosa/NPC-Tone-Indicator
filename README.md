# NPC-Tone-Indicator
Python | Pandas | Kraggle

Detect the NPC's tone on a basic positive/negative scale
- What is the NPC's overall perception of the player
- What is the NPC's objective when interacting with the player

Basic example:
  NPC: I’m feeling bad. Someone stole my horse. (Tone: Negative)

  Response Options:
  I am sorry that your horse got stolen. Do you need any help? (Positive)
  I don’t care. Your horse probably smells (Negative) 

Possible future implementations:
  Choosing best option to respond to npc (hedge your bets) → what would make the npc most happy with you
